The *Simple Consent Mode* plugin helps seamlessly integrate Google Tag Manager's (GTM) Consent Mode v2 on your website, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR. This lightweight plugin automatically configures Consent Mode and manages user consent for analytics and marketing cookies.

With Simple Consent Mode, you can dynamically adjust the behavior of your tags based on whether the user has granted or denied consent, while still gathering anonymous data when consent is not provided. The plugin makes it easy to implement, providing a simple interface for enabling and configuring consents, without needing to manually adjust code.
